SET OPERATORS
	
	# It is used to combine the result of two or more queries into a single result.
	
TYPES

	1.UNION
	2.UNION ALL
	3.INTERSECT
	4.MINUS
	
Rules:

	# Each query will have 2 select statements that are seperated by set operator.
	# Must have,
		Same number of columns
		Same datatype.
	# If using Aggregate function,all select statements much have their own GROUP BY CLAUSE.
	# All select statement must have a seperate FROM Clause.
	# Should give alias name is first select statement.not second
	# should give the Order by to Last Select statement.
	# If use ALL keyword it will wont't remove duplicates.
	
	
	
1.UNION

	# It returns only the unique/distinct result.
	
	# Output will be sorted by defalut(Without using order by).
	
	# Union is often slower than Union ALL. bcoz there is an operation to remove duplicates values,
														which is often a costly step in a query.(cpu)
														
	# Not suitable for performance turning bcoz it removes duplicate records.
	
	#  SELECT QUERY1
		UNION
	   SELECT QUERY2
	   
UNION ALL

	# It returns all the record from the query.
	
	# Output will not be sorted by default.
	
	# It will not remove the duplicate records.
	
	# suitable for performance turning bcoz it doe not removes duplicate records and sorting.
	
	# Union All is faster than Union.(bcoz does not remove duplicate value)
	
	# SELECT QUERY1,
	  UNION ALL
	  SELECT QUERY2;
	  
	  
INTERSECT

	# It returns all the common records from all the query.

	# Output will be sorted by default.
	
	# Remove deplicate.
	
	# SELECT QUERY1,
	  INTERSECT 
	  SELECT QUERY2;
	
	
	
MINUS 

	# It returns  all the records from one query result excluding the records from the other query result.
	
	# sorted by default.
	
	# remove duplicates.
	
	# SELECT QUERY1,
	  minus
	  SELECT QUERY2;
