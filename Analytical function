ANALYTIC FUNCTION
		* It compute an aggregate value based on group of rows.
		* It was introduced in oracle 8i.
		* It is used to perform tasks in SQL.
		
		
		SYNTAX
		
			* Analytic_function_name(arguments)
			 OVER([partition_clause][order_by_clause][windowing_clause])
			 
			* Partition_clause
				It clause is used to group the column value based on expression.
				This is optional.
				
			* Order_by_clause
				It is used to Order the data for each partition.
				This is optional.
				
			* Windowing_clause 
				It determines the rows in the analytic window to evaluate.
				This is optional,
				
				1.RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW.
					Last row in the window changes as the current row changes (default)
					
				2.RANGE BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING.
					First row in the window changes at the current row changes.
					
				3.RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING.
					All rows are included in the window.

			1.RANK
				# It used to returns the rank of a value in a group of values.
				# It skips the ranking if there is a tie between ranks.
				# It was introduced in 2005.

			2.DENSE_RANK
				# It is used to returns the rank of a value in a group of values.
				# It generates ranks continuously even if  there is a tie between ranks.
				# It was introduced in 2005.
			Syntax:
				#SELECT DENSE_RANK() 
					OVER (PARTITION BY Partition_column order by ordering_colums asc|desc)
					From Table_name;
		
			3.LEAD
				#It returns values from the next row in the table.
				#It canbe used in these versions---oracle12c,oracle11g,Oracle 10gi,Oracle 8i.

			SYNTAX
				#SELECT LEAD(EXPRESSION ,OFFSET)
					OVER(ORDER BY ORDERING_COLUMNS ASC|DESC)
					FROM TABLE_NAME;
			4.LAG
				#It Returns values from the previous row in the table.
				
			SYNTAX
				#SELECT LAG(EXPRESSION ,OFFSET)
					OVER(ORDER BY ORDERING_COLUMNS ASC|DESC)
					FROM TABLE_NAME;
			5.FIRST_VALUE
				#Used to return the FirstValue in an ordered set of values.
				#It can be used in these verison-----oracle 12c,Oracle 11g,Oracle 10g,Oracle 9i,Oracle 8i
				
			SYNTAX
				#SELECT DISTINCT FIRST_VALUE(output_column)
				OVER(PARTITION BY PARTITION_COLUMN ORDER BY ORDERING_COLPUMN ASC|DESC 
				RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING)
				FROM TABLE NAME;
			
			6.LAST_VALUE
				#Used to retrun the lastvalues in an ordered set of values.
				#It can be used in these version--oracle 12c,oracle 11g, oracle 10g,oracle 9i,oracle 8i.
				
			SYNTAX
			
				#SELECT DISTINCT LAST_VALUE(output_column)
				OVER(PARTITION BY PARTITION_COLUMN ORDER BY ORDERING_COLPUMN ASC|DESC 
				RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING)
				FROM TABLE NAME;
				
			7.NTH VALUE
				
				#Lets you find a specific position in the analytic window.
				#It was introduced in oracle 11g.
			
			SYSNTAX
				#SELECT NTH_VALUE(OUTPUT_COLUMN,N)
				
				OVER(PARTITION BY PARTITION_COLUMN ORDER BY ORDERING_COLUMNS ASC|DESC
				RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING)
				FROM TABLE_NAME;
				
				#OUTPUT COLUMN----->The Column that you want to return value.
				#n----->nth value of output_column in the analytic window that you wish to return.



 
GroupBy Clause 
		
		# Group by is used to  group rows that have same values.
		# Group by is used with aggregate function (min,max,sum,avg)


Having Clause
		# Having clause is used to restrict the result returned by the Group BY Clause.
		# Having clause acts same as where clause.
		
SYNTAX
		SELECT COLUMN_NAME1,COLUMN_NAME2,....
		FROM TABLE_NAME
		GROUP BY COLUMN_NAME1,COLUMN_NAME2,....
		[HAVING CONDITION];
